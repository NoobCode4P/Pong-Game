# **GLOWING PONG GAME (in 2D)**

# 1. Overview
***Pong game*** is known to be one of the most popular arcade sports video games. It is a 2D sports game simulating table tennis, where the players control a piece of thin rectangle shape called **paddle** by moving it vertically so as to stop the ball from passing through it and stop the opponent from scoring. Two players use the paddles to hit the ball back and forth until one of them scores and the game finishes when either of them competitively reaches 11 points before the other. 

This game follows the basic rules of the original one. In addition to that, I have added some different modes (**Player Vs Computer** with 3 different levels of difficulty and **Player Vs Player**) and *post-processing* effects to make the game a little bit more interesting and to have a better understanding of the `Unity Engines`. 

# 2. Game Controls
To move the paddle up or down in:

- **Player Vs Computer** mode: arrow keys &uarr;, &darr;
- **Player Vs Player** mode: 
    - keys W, S for Player 1
    - arrow keys &uarr;, &darr; for Player 2

respectively

# 3. Unity version
